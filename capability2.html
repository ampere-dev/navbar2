<h1>Driving Differentiators</h1>
					<br />
					<h3>Innovative - Dynamic</h3>
					<p>As innovation is inherently dynamic, Ampere develops or seeks quality improvements in existing products then develops new features, which are captured for company and client benefit.</p><br />
					<h3>Solution - Value Selling</h3>
					<p>To really shine in todays world, we do not just offer standard products. We take care in capitalizing on a process whereby we examine the clients pain points, diagnose by asking questions, derive and qualify ideas, demonstrate and educate client, solve clients problem and offer the final solution.</p><br />
					<h3>Strategic Management</h3>
					<p>We annually review our mission, objectives, and current business strategies. By doing so, we compare those items to external environments and competitive factors. We tweak existing parts, leave in pace others or develop new strategies and implement across the company, for further evaluation and critique. </p><br />
					<h3>Strategic Planning</h3>
					<p>The first step of any strategic planning starts with studying the overall market in which you are operating. This is done routinely assessing the industry, competitors and customer trends. Then we review our mission and vision statements and see if they are in alignment with our long-term vision goals.</p><br />
					<h3>Forward Thinking</h3>
					<p>Creativity is at the heart of Ampere, enabling entirely new ways of thinking and working. We like to identify opportunities, large or small, that no one else has noticed. We focus on creating value and  want to do things better, faster, efficient. Often times this risks—breaking rules, cutting across accepted boundaries, and going against the status quo.</p><br />
					<h3>65,700 hours experience</h3>
					<p>Working 12-hrs a day, six-days a week for over 15 years, has enabled a valuable skill-set that is worth sharing with clients. There are many companies that can offer the work-life balance, because they are larger and more mature,  however attempting to scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity.</p><br />
				    	<h3>Market Responsiveness</h3>
					<p>Constantly taking notes throughout the business cycle, enables us to find problems that others often overlook. In doing so, we can benchmark and respond to important customer culture drivers, set targets, take action and track progress. This in turn create's a unified focus on the customer.</p><br />
                    			<h3>Fun to Work With</h3>
					<p>One corollary to developing strong bonds of trust is that people are able to also have fun. This is due to the Levity Effect and increasing body of research demonstrates that when people lighten up and create a fun work environment, there is a significant increase in the level of trust, creativity and communication.</p><br />
				    	<h3>Technical Problem Solving</h3>
					<p>Ampere utilizes the TRIZ method for solving tough engineering problems. This methodology begins, by describing most every facet of a challenge in a chart form of forty principles. By utilizing these existing solutions, they inspire us to solve new problems and imagine innovative solutions.</p><br />
                    			<h3>Commissioning Expertise</h3>
					<p>Ampere will align with your commissioning agent (CxA), and incorporate our testing services into your commissioning schedule. Our commissioning engineers adhere to a thorough quality management process that validates and documents your systems. The methodology covers a wide range of procedures to verify the integrity and performance of your mission critical support infrastructure.</p><br />
				    	<h3>24/7 Client Service</h3>
					<p>We recognize round-the-clock availability as one of the most valuable assets of an organization, and being able to provide it with on-demand service and support paves the way towards loyalty and retention. The rapid dissemination of information has led to more informed customers, which has heightened the level of expectation they have from businesses. This is a key differentiator as it not only enhances the overall customer experience, but also allows you to capitalize on important opportunities for proactive customer engagement. 
</p><br />
                    			<h3>Process Improvement</h3>
					<p>Process improvement can, for example, cut costs and time noticeably in an organization. Through optimization, organization and visualization, duplicated work can be spotted. Resources are then rerouted and are allocated with efficiency and intelligence, which makes processes work better, spending less. </p><br />
				    	<h3>Logistics / Supply Chain</h3>
					<p>Logistics is the connection from one node or point to another; supply chain is a series of sequential nodes or points connected to one another. Logistics focuses on transporting goods while supply chain focuses on finished product and/or customers. Our goal at Ampere is to allow our customers to be so confident in our ability to deliver their product that they can devote their energy towards the core aspects of their business.</p><br />
                    			<h3>Improbable to Achievable</h3>
					<p>Have you ever been told "NO", "You cannot do that" or "Thats not possible"? We have, and it can be annoying to hear, especially when it's coming from within. We as a species, typically quit at around 40% of effort, but once you callous your mind over and force through it, you realize that we are capable of so much more. </p><br />
				    	<h3>Certified Ethical Hacker</h3>
					<p>A Certified Ethical Hacker is a skilled professional who understands and knows how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems and uses the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system.</p><br />
                    			<h3>Project Management Pro</h3>
					<p>The main purpose is to get projects done by following a formal (true and tested) process that generally consists of planning for the project, executing the project, and then closing the project in a controlled environment. Ampere has developed procedures in order to plan, coordinate and control the complex and diverse activities of modern industrial and commercial projects.</p><br />
