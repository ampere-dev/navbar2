			<h1>CAPABILITY STATEMENT</h1>
			<h2>Designed - Innovative - Dynamic</h2><br>
			<span>Ampere is a startup company that derived from the frustration of seeing rental customers being subjected to poor equipment maintenance, lack of knowledge from sales personnel, a disregard for support and gross neglect on project awareness from equipment providers. 

Ampere provides consulting on load banks, commissioning projects, power quality studies, battery systems, transformers, IR inspections, switchgear, power cables and overall quality control. 

We love challenges and thrive on making the improbable, possible and being in the industry since 1999, have seen basically everything one can dream up. We like to think of solutions to problems we haven't seen yet.</span>

<h1>Differentiators</h1>
					<br />
					<strong>Innovative - Dynamic</strong>
					<p>As innovation is inherently dynamic, we develop or see quality improvements in existing products then development new features for existing products, which are captured for company and client benefit.</p><br />
					<strong>Solution - Value Selling</strong>
					<p>To really shine in todays world, we do not just offer standard products. We take care in capatilizing on a process whereby we examine the clients pain points, diagnose by asking questions, derive and qualify ideas, demostrate and educate client, solve clients problem and offer the final solution.</p><br />
					<strong>Strategic Management</strong>
					<p>We annually review our mission, objectives, and current business stretegies. By doing so, we compare those items to external enviroments and competitive factors. We tweak existing parts, leave in pace others or develop new strategies and implement across the company, for further evaluation and critique. </p><br />
					<strong>Strategic Planning</strong>
					<p></p><br />
					<strong>Foward Thinking</strong>
					<p>Creativity is at the heart of Ampere, enabling entirely new ways of thinking and working. We like to identify opportunities, large or small, that no one else has noticed. We focus on creating value and  want to do things better, faster, effecient. Often times this risks—breaking rules, cutting across accepted boundaries, and going against the status quo.</p><br />
					<strong>65,700 hours experience</strong>
					<p>Working 12-hrs a day, six-days a week for over 15 years, has enabled a valuable skillset that is worth sharing with clients. There are many companies that can offer the work-life balance, because they are larger and more mature,  however attempting to scale necessarily requires extreme effort and relentless creativity.</p><br />
				    	<strong>Market Responsiveness</strong>
					<p>Constantly taking notes throughout the business cycle, enables us to find problems that others often overlook. In doing so, we can benchmark and respond to important customer culture drivers, set targets, take action and track progress. This in turn create's a unified focus on the customer.</p><br />
                    			<strong>Fun to Work With</strong>
					<p>One corollary to developing strong bonds of trust is that people are able to also have fun. This is due to the Levity Effect and increasing body of research demonstrates that when people lighten up and create a fun work enviroment, there is a significant increase in the level of trust, creativity and communication.</p><br />
				   	<strong>Product Augmentation</strong>
					<p></p><br />
                    			<strong>Fanatical About Quality</strong>
					<p></p><br />
				    	<strong>Technical Problem Solving</strong>
					<p></p><br />
                    			<strong>Commissioning Expertise</strong>
					<p></p><br />
				    	<strong>24/7 Client Service</strong>
					<p></p><br />
                    			<strong>Process Improvement</strong>
					<p></p><br />
				    	<strong>Logistics / Supply Chain</strong>
					<p></p><br />
                    			<strong>Improbable to Achievable</strong>
					<p></p><br />
				    	<strong>Certified Ethical Hacker</strong>
					<p>A Certified Ethical Hacker is a skilled professional who understands and knows how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems and uses the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system.</p><br />
                    			<strong>Project Management Pro</strong>
					<p>The main purpose is to get projects done by following a formal (true and tested) process that generally consists of planning for the project, executing the project, and then closing the project in a controlled environment. Ampere has developed procedures in order to plan, coordinate and control the complex and diverse activities of modern industrial and commercial projects.</p><br />
