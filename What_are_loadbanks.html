<h1>What are load banks?</h1>

<p>A load bank is a device which develops an electrical load, via resistance, an inductance or capacitance and applies said load to an electrical power source. The load bank converts said load into an electric or magnetic field, or dissipates the resultant power output of the source as heat, and is cooled by an electric motor and fan providing the appropriate cubic-foot-minute (CFM) of air.

<p>A load bank includes load elements with protection, control, metering, and accessory devices required for operation. Load banks are used for testing power sources such as standby generators and batteries.

<p>A load bank is a calibrated device which converts the electric power from a power-generation source into one of the three aforementioned electrical loads.

<p>A load bank can be incrementally controlled to test the operation of critical systems under varying conditions in order to determine the system response to changes.

<p>The purpose of a load bank is to accurately mimic the operational or “real” load that a power source will see in actual application. However, unlike the “real” load, which is likely to be dispersed, unpredictable and random in value, a load bank provides a contained, organized and fully controllable load.

<h2>Why conduct load bank tests?</h2>

<p>The main goal of load bank testing is to uncover problems in a controlled situation rather than during an actual power failure. Load bank testing should be conducted during initial system installations, but also as part of a regular maintenance program.

<p>Load bank testing is the only way to verify a backup power system will operate during an outage. Backup systems such as generators and UPS equipment may perform adequately under light loads. However, without regular testing, they may fail to deliver a full power load.

<p>Load bank testing ensures your backup systems are up to the task. When operating under light loads for extended periods, diesel generators may experience a condition called “wet stacking.” Wet stacking happens when carbon or unburned fuel oil accumulates in the exhaust system. This accumulation reduces output and may permanently damage the generator. Wet stacking can be corrected simply by running the generator engine under a sufficient load for a few hours.

<p>Standards compliance may dictate load bank testing. For example, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) “Standard for Emergency and Standby Power Systems” provides requirements for initial commissioning of an emergency power supply, as well as ongoing testing. Other standards organizations imposing mandates for load testing include the ANSI/NETA Standard for Maintenance Testing Specifications for Electrical Power Equipment and Systems, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

<p>During data center commissioning, load banks can be used to test mechanical cooling systems by simulating the heat load of critical electrical systems. Water-cooled load banks also test chiller plants to ensure they meet their design ratings.

<p>Chiller plant testing is a part of an integrated system test where all systems are tested as a whole – as they are installed. This testing will sometimes uncover problems that do not get detected in component level testing and factory testing.

<h2>What happens during a load bank test?</h2>

<p>Load bank testing is a way of validating the correct operational performance and battery autonomy of the UPS system. It tests the UPS and generator under load conditions. It is most often carried out during preventative maintenance. As a UPS battery set is only as strong as its weakest battery cell, load bank testing can also be used to ascertain the condition of UPS batteries and battery sets (or ‘strings’ as they are also known) to indicate if any individual cells are approaching the end of their working life and not holding a charge or about to fail. This enables them to be replaced in advance of critical application.

<p>Load bank testing is offered as a service by suppliers of power protection equipment, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies Limited. Some suppliers offer load bank testing as part of the UPS commissioning process but caution must be exercised: ideally it should be carried out at least one week after the UPS has been commissioned to permit the voltage across the battery blocks to equalize and batteries to be fully charged. Load bank testing prior to this will not yield accurate results, or give a true picture of how the system is running, and thus be a waste of time and money.

<p>A generator load bank test involves an examination and assessment of a genset. It verifies that all primary components of the generator set are in proper working condition. The equipment used to conduct a load bank test produces artificial loads on the generator by bringing the engine to an appropriate operating temperature and pressure level. This is especially important for standby and emergency generator sets that do not run very often and/or may not be exposed to carrying heavy loads on a frequent basis. The general rule is - if your generator is not exposed to higher than 30% of its rated kW load then you should be considering a load test.

<p>A load bank test ensures that your generator will run property when it’s needed so that you can fully depend on it during an emergency situation. The key to a proper load bank test is that it tests your generator at its full kilowatt (kW) output rating. Because many generators do not regularly operate at their full kW rating, it's especially important that you verify your generator can actually produce the highest possible horsepower that may be required - while at the same time maintaining adequate temperature and pressure levels that will allow it to run as long as necessary.
	
 <h2>Benefits of Load Bank Testing</h2>

	</ul>
<h2>Industries served by load banks</h2>

<li>Telecom</li>

<li>Marine - Mining - Medical</li> 
<li>Data Centers</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Load bank types commonly used</h2>

<p>The three most common types of load banks are resistive, inductive, and capacitive. Both inductive and capacitive loads create what is known as reactance in an AC circuit. Reactance is a circuit element's opposition to an alternating current, caused by the buildup of electric or magnetic fields in the element due to the current and is the "imaginary" component of impedance, or the resistance to AC signals at a certain frequency.

<h3>Resistive load bank</h3>

<p>A resistive load bank, the most common type, provides equivalent loading for both generators and prime movers. That is, for each kilowatt (or horsepower) of load applied to the generator by the load bank, an equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator. A resistive load bank, therefore, removes energy from the complete system: load bank from generator—generator from prime mover—prime mover from fuel. Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive load bank operation: waste heat from coolant, exhaust and generator losses and energy consumed by accessory devices. A resistive load bank impacts upon all aspects of a generating system.

<p>The load of a resistive load bank is created by the conversion of electrical energy to heat via high-power resistors such as wire-wound resistors. This heat must be dissipated from the load bank, either by air or by water, by forced means or convection.

<h3>Reactive load bank</h3>

<p>Industrial electrical loads are comprised of both resistive and reactive type loads. Reactive, or reactance as it is commonly known, is a circuit element's opposition to an alternating current, caused by the build up of electric or magnetic fields in the element due to the current. Both fields act to produce counter EMF that is proportional to either the rate of change (time derivative), or accumulation (time integral) of the current. In vector analysis, reactance is the imaginary part of electrical impedance, used to compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going through the circuit element.

<p>Reactance, in itself, can mean either inductance (Positive Reactance) or capacitance (Negative Reactance).

<h3>Inductive load bank</h3>

<p>An inductive load includes inductive (lagging power factor) loads.

<p>An inductive load consists of an iron-core reactive element which, when used in conjunction with a resistive load bank, creates a lagging power factor load. Typically, the inductive load will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductive load is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc.

<h3>Capacitive load bank</h3>

<p>A capacitive load bank is similar to an inductive load bank, except leading power factor loads are created. These loads simulate certain electronic or non-linear loads typical of telecommunications, computer or UPS industries. Harmonic currents generated by nonlinear loads are becoming a pervasive problem. A "nonlinear" electrical load is a load on the electrical utility that requires a current from the utility, whose electrical waveform is non-sinusoidal. Computers, fax machines, printers, electronic lighting ballasts, and variable-speed drives are prime examples of nonlinear loads that are capable of generating harmonic currents.

<h3>Resistive/Reactive Load Banks</h3>

<p>With a resistive-inductive load bank, full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment. Furthermore, the following functions can be performed.
<ul>
    <li>Positive and Negative Reactance</li>
<li>Motor load simulation</li>
<li>Q-factor resonance</li>
<li>RLC network simulation</li>
<li>UL1741 - IEEE 1547 Anti-islanding commissioning</li>
</ul>

<h3>Electronic load bank</h3>

<p>An electronic load bank tends to be a fully programmable, air- or water-cooled design used to simulate a solid state load and to provide constant power and current loading on circuits for precision testing.

<p>Namely there are two types, AC and DC and commonly used to test power supplies, batteries and fuel cells.

<p>In addition, any active or passive current carrying devices such as switches, circuit breakers, fuses, connectors and power semiconductors can be tested. Traditionally, many of these products are tested using resistive load banks. This approach does not simulate real-world conditions such as switching DC/AC converters found in many AC powered products. This type of conventional testing does not fully exercise the equipment under test (EUT) under worst case operating conditions. High peak currents and low power factor loads can significantly impact the operating characteristics of a UPS or AC power product.

<p>Typically five modes of operation:
<ul>
	<li>Constant Current</li>
<li>Constant Voltage </li>
<li>Constant Power </li>
<li>Constant Resistance </li>
<li>Pulse frequency or Short circuit </li>
	</ul>
<h3>Battery Load Banks</h3>

<p>Direct current load banks are commonly used to test UPS and telecom battery strings.

<h3>Medium Voltage Load Banks</h3>

<p>A medium-voltage load bank is just like any other load bank commonly used, in that it contains resistors, reactors or capacitors. The voltage rating typically is 15kV being the maximum impressed potential allowed. This negates transformers, and allows for longer runs of cables and smaller conductors.

<p>Generally there are three kinds of medium-voltage load banks in use today:
<ul>
<li>Low-Voltage with transformer</li>
<li>Container with transformer</li>
<li>Direct connection</li>
	</ul>
<p>The use of a transformer in such situations allow for <500kW load-step resolution. The direct connection method, being much lighter and less labor intensive, just required medium-voltage cable form the source.

<h3>Server Simulating Load Banks</h3>

<p>Are load banks that models real-world scenarios, confirms air-flow computational fluid dynamics modeling and maximizing power utilization effectiveness (PUE).

<p>These are 19" rack-mountable devices used to model true hot-aisle/cold-aisle situations, heat and air flow in data centers.

<p>Variable controls provide for granular airflow, Delta-T and deferential pressure compensation at various altitudes. This allows the operator to fine-tune the load bank, as to mimic the server it is modeling and match the environmental conditions.

<p>Variable fan speed control allows adjustment of CFM, Temperature Delta, altitude compensation and can be used to fine-tune the applied load.

<p>Data-centers are built to maintain a 2N (A/B) utility grid redundancy and the CRLS load bank was designed to facilitate that network design. The Load Bank has three load steps per channel, and allows for seven various load combinations, providing for a fine load step resolution.

<p>Either channel A or B can be intentionally disabled via the master load switch. In doing so, the fans and electrical load on that channel can be shutoff to inhibit load application for that channel.

<h3>Non-Linear Load Banks</h3>

<p>A load is considered non-linear if its impedance changes with the applied voltage. The changing impedance means that the current drawn by the non-linear load will not be sinusoidal even when it is connected to a sinusoidal voltage. These nonsinusoidal currents contain harmonic currents that interact with the impedance of the power distribution system to create voltage distortion that can affect both the distribution system equipment and the loads connected to it.

<p>In the past, non-linear loads were primarily found in heavy industrial applications such as arc furnaces, large variable frequency drives (VFD), heavy rectifiers for electrolytic refining, etc. The harmonics they generated were typically localized and often addressed by knowledgeable experts.

<h3>400HZ Load Banks</h3>

<p>Power frequencies as high as 400 Hz are used in aircraft, spacecraft, submarines and  military equipment. Transformers, for example, can be made smaller because the magnetic core can be much smaller for the same power level. Induction motors turn at a speed proportional to frequency, so a high-frequency power supply allows more power to be obtained for the same motor volume and mass. Transformers and motors for 400 Hz are much smaller and lighter than at 50 or 60 Hz, which is an advantage in aircraft and ships.

<p>Resistive load banks typically can handle 400Hz without a problem, only the reactive loads must be built specifically for the frequency. Everything else mentioned before still applies.

<h3>Regenerative Load Banks</h3>

<p>Regenerative braking is the process of opposing inertial load by converting kinetic energy to electricity. Regenerative braking is essential for generator powered moving machinery that carries and moves vast weights such as elevators, cranes and hoists.

<h3>Water-Cooled Load Banks</h3>

<p>Often times, situations require customers to test power supplies, namely generators and UPS systems, in locations that are not conducive to normal forced-air cooled load banks, either due to environment or physical constraints.

<p>In these situations, very long runs of cable may be used, but voltage-drop due to Ohms law may pose and add to the existing challenge.

<p>So this leaves us with an open-loop, water-cycle load cell, whereby chilled water is supplied to a device with heating elements, think of it as an expensive hot-water heater.

<p>Please note, these can also be used to test data center chillers as well.
