<h3>Data Centers</h3>
<p>The failure of critical systems in data centers (such as generators or UPS systems) is all too common and can be extremely devastating, even in facilities designed for high reliability. Facilities designed and built for high reliability must pay careful attention to electrical, cooling, and redundant power infrastructure. Regular load bank testing can keep your mission-critical data center back-up power operating as it should. For ideas on how to set up a routine maintenance, call one of our load bank specialists today.

For mission-critical facilities where uptime is expected, load bank testing of all power systems must be a vital component of the regular maintenance, in order to achieve dependable power and data protection. Even in highly successful mission-critical facilities, with elaborate fault-tolerant system design, intended to achieve the highest level of reliability in the industry, periodic testing and system verification is a must in order to reach maximum sustainability.

Loadbanks of America has experience in the deployment of load banks for data center commissioning, as well as ongoing maintenance and testing.

<h3>Generator Systems</h3>
<p>Generators are a key part of many industry backup power systems. Load banks are used to verify the power output from new generators once they are placed on location. Though generators are tested at the factory, it is important to re-test the generator on site. Variables with fuel systems, exhaust systems, cooling systems, regulator and governor systems, as well as altitude and ambient temperature factors can affect generator performance. Additionally, routine testing for the life of the generator is imperative to achieve a system you can depend on.

Problems related to fuel system contamination, cooling system degradation, and diesel engine “wet-stacking” are common reasons to conduct regular testing.

<h3>Facilities Management</h3>
<p>Facilities managers are finding their work increasingly focused on proactive ways to avoid emergencies. We can help you proactively avoid emergencies while also maximizing your power systems so that you aren’t wasting energy.

Improving your overall energy usage can help you comply with new “green” initiatives. For example, with your Diesel Generator Systems, we offer load banks for testing that can help you avoid diesel engine “wet stacking” and ultimately engine performance problems that can lead to equipment failure when you need it most.

Additionally, we offer load banks for testing UPS systems, DC battery systems, electrical distribution systems, circuit breakers, and virtually all electrical systems in your facility. From newly installed systems to existing systems, from commissioning to routine preventative maintenance testing, load banks offer you the tool to verify that your facilities’ electrical systems are performing properly and as designed. Call today for a free consultation; we are here to help.

<h3>UPS</h3>
<p>A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply System) is a part of many emergency backup power systems. Data Centers, Hospitals, Government and Military Operations, as well as Businesses of all sizes rely on UPS systems to protect against utility power problems.

The failure of a UPS or Generator can bring devastating results to mission-critical facilities. Regular maintenance and testing, including the use of load banks, are vital to any operation. Power outages, power surges, brown-outs, and other power quality problems are all risks that can be well-managed with a good UPS System.

The system must be selected for the correct application, be properly installed and tested, and be properly maintained to insure it’s reliability. As many UPS systems are supported with Standby Generators, UPS performance problems can sometimes be hidden for months by the generator and extended periods of reliable utility power. Regular testing of the UPS to determine performance of sub-systems, like batteries, can help avoid unexpected system failure. Loadbanks of America offers AC and DC load bank rentals, providing customized solutions to many UPS Systems professionals.
